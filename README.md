# First Flutter Project ✨

This is my first mobile application built using **Flutter** and **Dart**.

The project includes a **Sign-Up screen** where users can enter their name, email, and password. The interface is built using basic Flutter widgets and follows a clean and simple design.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Flutter SDK
- Dart Programming Language
- Android Studio
- Git & GitHub

## 📂 Screens Implemented

### ✅ signup_screen.dart

- A user registration screen with:
  - `TextFormField` for name, email, and password
  - A `Sign Up` button
  - UI layout built using `Column` and `Padding`
  - Simple light-themed design

## 🚀 How I Built It

1. Opened Android Studio and created a new Flutter project.
2. Created a new Dart file `signup_screen.dart` inside the `lib/` directory.
3. Designed the UI using Flutter widgets.
4. Initialized a Git repository from Android Studio.
